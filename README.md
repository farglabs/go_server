# go_server
An extremely simple base server in golang for jump-starting an HTTP API endpoint microservice project. Secure, light-weight and can be built for any platform to a single executable!

At this point, all served code/data should be contained within main.go (or at least called from there). The inability to serve static HTML files (and other files) is intentional; if you want to take on that security risk, go use Apache or Nginx.

## Instructions
Just build and run!

Build:

``$ go build``

Run on Linux:

``$ ./server``

Run on Windows:

``$ server.exe``
